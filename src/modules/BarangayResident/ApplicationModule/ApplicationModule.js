The secretary will just edit and print the document easily if you are the only one asking for it. It will also be signed by the Barangay Chairman, so if s/he is not there, you might as well go back at a specified time.

However, if they’re not another person in command might sign if s/he was given authority. Please also note that you must be living in the Barangay for at least 3 or 6 months to be issued one. </p><p> With your Barangay clearance, you can now apply for an NBI Clearance, a Postal ID, or a UMID ID to get a Valid Passport. You can also use it to apply for a Bank Account especially if you are still a student.
